# Computational-Physics

A repository of code I wrote for my class on Computational Physics 1. 

Almost all the code is written in Python (optimization required). 
The code concerns topics such as: Interpolation, FFT, Wavelet transforms, Parallel computing, Big-code, ODE solvers, Root finding algorithms and more...

Homeworks 7, 8 and 9 in this repository do not contain the original code file as they were lost in the process of moving data between the university supercomputer (Harlow) and my local one.
